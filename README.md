<h1> Visualizing The Relationship Between Quadratic Julia Sets And Quadratic Mandelbrot Sets </h1>
<h2> Abstract </h2>
Quadratic Julia sets and quadratic Mandelbrot sets are orthogonal cross-sections of one function with two complex parameters. It can be hard to grasp how exactly those two are related. My thesis aims to visualize the connection and help people understand how Julia sets and Mandelbrot sets are related.
